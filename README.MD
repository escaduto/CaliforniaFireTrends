# A Comprehensive Guide to: Understanding Fire Driver’s Across California’s Diverse Ecoregions

##  Project Description
Wildland fires at varying intensities and frequencies are a critical ecological process across the western
United States. Variability in fire behavior is heavily influenced by dynamic and often complex
interactions between meteorological and biophysical components. This study uses a machine learning
approach to investigate what factors are linked to the rapid spread of large wildfires in the recent decade,
across six distinct ecoregions in California. Continuous daily fire spread and area burned were derived
from MODIS and VIIRS active fire products. Ultimately the results from this study seek to provide
insights on the efficacy of fuel management on reducing the rate of fire progression across ecologically
diverse regions and help communities and managers to better anticipate and mitigate future risk of fast
moving wildfires in the coming decades.

## Introduction
This documentation is meant to serve as a guide to execute the central workflow of the project (Figure 1).
Six primary iPython notebooks (.ipynb) files are made available under /drive/California FireTrends
(2012-2020)/Scripts to run consecutively. We recommend using Google Colab, which is a Python
development environment that allows you to run Jupyter notebooks in the browser i.e. so you don’t have
to locally. When running the scripts using Google’s Colab notebook, each step has pre-existing set-up
lines to enable a smooth runtime. Although unlikely, to prevent any overloading and crashes when using
[Colab Pro](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/pro.ipynb) be sure to access the high-memory runtime whenever available.
